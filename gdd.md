# Concept

## Gameplay Overview

The game starts with only a few units. The goal is to repair the spacecraft to 
leave the planet. The player needs to start gathering resources and building 
a base in order to survive. Eventually the planet's creatures notice the player 
and attack the base.

## Theme Interpretation (It's spreading)

The player needs to become stronger to survive and leave the planet. However 
this doesn't come without a cost. The environment will suffer from the
machines and fast spreading pollution coming from them.

## Primary Mechanics

### Base building

Different machines can be built to grow the base and progress in the game.

### Enemies

Enemies will attack units and parts of the base to stop 
the pollution.

### Resources

Resources need to be gathered to build the base. Different resources can be
found around the map.

### Pollution

Pollution will spread on the map damaging the environment and upsetting
the creatures living on the planet.

## Secondary Mechanics

### Damaged environment

Environment will start absorbing the pollution. Grass and flowers will 
eventually die near the base.

# Art

## Theme Interpretation

The planet will have nice green grass and plants. This will start
changing over time when the player spreads the pollution and builds their base.
Plants will start looking dead, flowers will drop petals and the grass will turn
brown.

## Design

The game will mostly feel like Dune 2. Simple pixel art will go well with
this style. Colors will first be similar to those found in nature and they will
eventually change to colors that look dry and dead. Machines will have
gray and a slightly futuristic design.

# Audio

## Sound Effects

Units, enemies, and buildings will have sound effects when damaged.

# Game Experience

## UI

Design of the UI follows similar design as the machines and
other player built things.
