# Concept

## Gameplay Overview

The game starts with a single unit. The goal is to build a rocket to leave the
planet. The player needs to start gathering resources and building a base to
survive. Eventually the native species notice the player and attack the base.

## Theme Interpretation (It's spreading)

The player needs to become stronger in order to survive and leave the planet.
However this doesn't come without a cost. The environment will suffer from the
machines and fast spreading pollution coming out of the machines.

## Primary Mechanics

### Base building

Different machines can be built to grow the base.

### Enemies

Enemies will attack different parts of the base to stop the pollution.

### Resources

Resources need to be gathered to build the base. Different resources will be
found around the map.

### Pollution

Pollution will spread on the map damaging the environment and upsetting
the creatures living on the planet.

## Secondary Mechanics

### Running out of resources

There are limited resources on the planet. Spending them incorrectly will slow
down or even doom the player.

### Damaged environment

Environment will start absorbing the pollution. Grass and trees will eventually
die near the base.

# Art

## Theme Interpretation

The planet will have nice green grass and big forests. This will start
changing over time when the player spreads the pollution and build their base.
Plants will start looking dead, trees will drop leaves and the grass will turn
brown.
